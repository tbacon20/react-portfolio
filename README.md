# BYU-IS-portfolio-demo
This is a MERN web template designed to display personal portfolio and resume for BYU IS students. This program was accomplished for IS405 final project in Fall 2022.
It will serve as a recource for people would like to build either full stack apps or a personal React app.

***The program consists of MERN stack which is MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as the web development framework.***

Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:
- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data
- **NodeJS**: The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser
- **ExpressJS**: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed
- **ReactJS**: A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application
